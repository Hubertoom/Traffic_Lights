# Traffic Lights

## Learning outcomes

Creating console application "traffic light". It covers topics like multithreading in Java, <br/>
handling exceptions, inheriting classes and implementing and applying the ***circular queue*** data structure.

## About the project

Do you know how traffic lights were invented? Some time ago, it was decided to replace the traffic police officers <br/> 
with a looped automated system that gives information to drivers about whether they can continue driving or not. <br/> 
In this project, we will implement a simplified version of such a system for a road junction in which many roads converge into one.
